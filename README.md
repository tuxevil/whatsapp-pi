# WhatsApp-Pi

A WhatsApp integration extension for the **[Pi Coding Agent](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent)**.

Pi is a powerful agentic AI coding assistant that operates in your terminal. This extension allows you to chat and pair-program with your Pi agent directly through WhatsApp, featuring message filtering, allow-listing, and reliable message delivery.

## Features

- **Manual WhatsApp Connection**: QR code-based authentication with session persistence
- **Allow List**: Control which numbers can interact with Pi
  - Add contacts with optional names for easy identification
  - View ignored numbers (not in allow list) and add them when needed
- **Reliable Messaging**: Queue-based message sending with retry logic
- **TUI Integration**: Menu-driven interface for managing connections and contacts

## Prerequisites

To enable audio features, you need to install OpenAI Whisper:
```bash
python -m pip install -U openai-whisper
```

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension:
```bash
pi install npm:whatsapp-pi
```

2. Start Pi (the extension will load automatically once installed):
```bash
pi
```

To automatically connect to WhatsApp on startup (if you are already authenticated):
```bash
pi --whatsapp-pi-online
```

3. Use the menu to connect WhatsApp and manage allowed/blocked numbers

## Development / Testing

If you are developing or testing the extension locally, you can clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/RaphaCastelloes/whatsapp-pi):

1. Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaphaCastelloes/whatsapp-pi.git
cd whatsapp-pi
npm install
```

2. Run the extension:
```bash
pi -e whatsapp-pi.ts
```

For verbose mode (shows Baileys trace logs for debugging):
```bash
pi -e whatsapp-pi.ts --verbose
```

## Implementation Notes

### Recent Feature Updates (2026-04)

- **Auto-Connect Support**: Use the `--whatsapp-pi-online` flag to automatically connect to WhatsApp on startup if you have a valid active session.
- **Vision Analysis**: Images sent via WhatsApp are automatically downloaded and forwarded to the Pi agent as base64, enabling vision-based interactions.
- **Document Message Support**: 
  - WhatsApp documents (PDFs, text files, etc.) are downloaded and saved to `./.pi-data/whatsapp/documents/`.
  - The Pi agent receives a notification with the file path and metadata.
  - **Prerequisite**: Install `pdftotext` (part of `poppler-utils`) to allow the agent to read PDF content via the `bash` tool.
- **Verbose Mode**: Enhanced logging for the WhatsApp connection lifecycle and message processing. Use `--verbose` to see Baileys trace logs.
- **Storage Management**: All persistent data (auth state, documents, config) is centralized in the `.pi-data/` directory.
