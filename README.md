# WhatsApp-Pi

WhatsApp integration for Pi coding agent with message filtering, blocking, and reliable message delivery.

## Features

- **Manual WhatsApp Connection**: QR code-based authentication with session persistence
- **Allow List**: Control which numbers can interact with Pi
  - Add contacts with optional names for easy identification
  - View ignored numbers (not in allow list) and add them when needed
- **Reliable Messaging**: Queue-based message sending with retry logic
- **TUI Integration**: Menu-driven interface for managing connections and contacts

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the extension:
```bash
pi -e whatsapp-pi.ts
```

3. Use the menu to connect WhatsApp and manage allowed/blocked numbers

## Commands

- `/whatsapp` - Open the WhatsApp management menu
  - **Allow Numbers**: Manage contacts that can interact with Pi
  - **Blocked Numbers**: View ignored numbers (not in allow list) and add them to allow list

## Important Configuration

### Using Your Own WhatsApp Number

If you're using your **own WhatsApp number** (not a separate bot number), you need to modify the message filtering in `src/services/whatsapp.service.ts`:

**Remove this line from `handleIncomingMessages()`:**
```typescript
// Ignore messages sent by the bot itself
if (msg.key.fromMe) return;
```

**Why?** When using your own number:
- Pi sends messages from your account (marked with `π` symbol)
- The `fromMe` filter blocks ALL your outgoing messages, including Pi's responses
- The `π` symbol check is sufficient to prevent message loops

**Keep this check:**
```typescript
// Ignore messages sent by Pi (marked with π)
const text = msg.message?.conversation || msg.message?.extendedTextMessage?.text || "";
if (text.endsWith('π')) return;
```

This ensures Pi doesn't process its own sent messages while still receiving messages from others.
